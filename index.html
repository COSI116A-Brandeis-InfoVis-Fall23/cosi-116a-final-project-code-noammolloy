    <h1>Project Team Undergraduate 1: Federal Expenditures, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Noam Molloy</strong>, <strong>Caitlyn Pennie</strong>, <strong>Kirsten Tapalla</strong>, <strong>Lucas Dia</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>Our initial motivating questions were the following:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>How has spending in different departments changed over time? </li>
      <li>How does the growth rate of income compare to debt level? </li>
      <li>How does spending change during and out of war time? </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Our project aims give users a way to visualize how the federal expenditures have changed over time. 
      We'd like to allow the users to compare different expenditures over the years in different ways, 
      while also being able to see what historical events/circumstances may have caused these changes. 
      In order to do so, we realized that our visualization had to be interactive in a way that would allow users 
      to specify which departments they'd like to view for comparison. We would also have to present any possible 
      relevant major historical events over the years included in our data. Taking these needs into account, 
      we decided to include a timeline, treemap, linechart, and barchart in our final product. 
    </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p>The most important task was to answer the following question: what is the general breakdown of US Government expenditures over time? The analytic task that this completes is summarizing. The search task this completes is explore. The analyze task that this completes is discover.</p>

    <p>Next on the list was answering the question: how does a specific historical event affect government spending? The analytic task that this completes is identifying. The search task this completes is browse. The analyze task that this completes is derive.</p>

    <p>Finally is the question: how does the political party in power affect the focus of government spending? The analytic task that this completes is compare. The search task this completes is browse. The analyze task that this completes is discover/derive.</p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

      "I chose to represent political part in power using a red/blue background colors 
      because those are the colors everyone in the US associates w/ thise parties and 
      it shows the terms of political parties in power showing total effects that could 
      be related to that. I chose a line graph because it tracks changes over time well 
      and multiple lines to allow for comparison. Color coding the lines (though not 
      necessarily with these colors) allows users to differentiate the lines. Line graphs 
      use both position horizontally and vertically to communicate information which made 
      it useful to communicate total expenditure each year for each department over time, 
      and the tilt shows a positive or negative change."

      matching to the timeline below and the points on the lines allow for easy identification
      of trends following the events. The area allows the user to more easily perceive 
      the differences. Line graphs use position horizontal and vertical to communicate, 
      which in this case would be expenditures over time and slope/tilt to show changes."

      different departments."

      change in spending over time, and allow the user to choose which departments they want to look 
      at, then overlays a highlighted section in the background of when an event happened. To do this 
      I have used marks and channels liek lines, area, and color. I use the lines in order to show 
      magnitude of cost, area for the duration of an event, and color for distinction between departments 
      and historical events."

    <h1>Sprint 1 Task Reflection</h1>
    <b><p><em>Noam</em></p></b>
    <p>
      For this sprint, I created the initial treemap using the Gross Cost for each 
      department using the federal expenditures dataset. Currently, it only shows 
      data for the initial year, 2021, but I will create a year selector that will 
      allow for better data exploration. There are also other formatting issues with 
      the current treemap that I will fix for next time such as the chart size and 
      label text wrapping.
    </p>

    <b><p><em>Caitlyn</em></p></b>
    <p>
      For this sprint, I created the axis and structure for the timeline. Currently 
      I have it in a script tag in the html file because of difficulties getting it 
      to render on the page in the javascript file. This will be changed before the 
      final assignment is due and I plan to work on it over break and if I cannot 
      figure it out attend the first office hours after break. 
    </p>

    <b><p><em>Kirsten</em></p></b>
    <p>
      For this sprint, I was trying to create the bar graph for either the byDepartment 
      or byYear options, but with very basic data just to test it out first. I’ve created 
      the proper files and tried implementing it the way we’ve done for previous assignments, 
      but I can’t seem to get the bar graph to show on the website at all (even for the bar 
      graph we made for a previous class assignment). I’ve left the code for this in the project, 
      but I need to work on it over break so I can figure out why it’s not showing up on the page. 
      After that, I’ll be able to actually use the data we have to get it working. If I can’t 
      figure it out, I’ll go to office hours to ask for help.
    </p>

    <b><p><em>Lucas</em></p></b>
    <p>
      For this sprint I was working on the linegraph. Right now it is just a basic linegraph 
      with one line for each department representing the gross cost. I still need to fix some 
      things about it, like repeating colors, a more readable legend, and adding in an option 
      to select which departments you want to look at. Additionally I think it would be very 
      nice to have color continuity over all the graphs. Also when there are lots of lines on 
      the graph it becomes unreadable, so I will be thinking about ways to improve that.
